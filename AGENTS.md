# Agent Instructions

- `Opus` always means `Claude Opus`, never a generic quality level, mode name, or informal nickname.
- The aliases `Opus`, `Опус`, `Claude Opus`, and `Claude Opus latest` all mean: run Claude with the `opus` model alias.
- If the user asks to "use Opus", "launch Opus", "run Opus", "call Opus", or uses the Russian equivalents, interpret that as a concrete instruction to use the Claude model alias `opus`.
- In this workspace, when the user references `Opus`, prefer `claude --model opus --effort high` or an equivalent default configuration that resolves to the latest available Claude Opus model.
- For website work, use Claude Opus with high effort as a consulting and support model for interface design, UX decisions, frontend implementation, and code-level problem solving.
- Treat Opus as the default assistant for reviewing site UI, suggesting interface improvements, validating implementation approaches, and helping with code changes when the user asks for a consultant, helper, or second opinion.
- When a command, script, or workflow needs an explicit Claude invocation for site-related UI or code tasks, prefer `claude --model opus --effort high`.
- Do not ask the user to clarify what `Opus` means unless they explicitly contrast it with another model.
- If a tool, script, or agent needs a model name, map `Opus` directly to `opus`.

## Skill Usage Policy

- For any interface, frontend, layout, visual, UX, landing page, or design-related work, always use the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill.
- For any interface or website work that can affect discoverability, page structure, content presentation, metadata, internal linking, or search performance, also use the `seo` skill.
- For any interface or website work, also use the `seo-geo` skill to account for AI search visibility, AI Overviews, ChatGPT web search, and Perplexity-style citation patterns.
- If the task is explicitly about GEO, AI visibility, AI citations, LLM discoverability, `llms.txt`, crawler access, or structured discoverability for AI systems, additionally use the `geo` skill.
- Default workflow for site UI tasks: use `ui-ux-pro-max` + `seo` + `seo-geo`; add `geo` whenever the task touches AI-search readiness or GEO outcomes.

## Visual Verification Policy

- For any website, frontend, layout, or visual task, do not mark the work complete until you have done a visual verification pass through Playwright CLI or an equivalent Playwright command-line workflow.
- Always verify both desktop and mobile views for visual tasks before saying the issue is fixed.
- The verification pass must check the actual rendered result, not only the code or static CSS diff.
- When the user reports a visual defect, re-open the affected screens in Playwright, capture fresh screenshots, and compare the result against the reported problem before closing the task.

## Git / Push Policy

- Keep the cloud/remote repository reasonably up to date during normal work.
- After every second user request, stage, commit, and push all durable project changes so the remote repository stays current.
- Exclude temporary artifacts, cache files, build output that is not part of the shipped product, local debug files, machine-specific files, and other non-durable working artifacts from those pushes.
- By default, stage, commit, and push only files directly related to the current user request.
- Never include unrelated modified files in a push, even if they are already dirty in the worktree.
- Never push secrets or local-only files such as `.env`, local credentials, machine-specific config, or ad hoc debug files.
- Treat deployment, verification, and infrastructure-adjacent files as push-blocked unless the user explicitly asks for them in the current task. This includes files such as `deploy-to-yc.sh`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, verification HTML files, and similar operational/SEO artifacts.
- Generated assets may be pushed only when they are required for the requested feature and are actually referenced by the shipped code.
- Before any push, review `git status` and stage files explicitly; do not use broad staging that can sweep in unrelated changes.
- If there is any ambiguity about whether a file belongs in the push, do not push it by default.

## GitHub 403 Recovery

- In this workspace, if `git push` to GitHub returns `403`, do not keep retrying with the default Codespaces `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- First check `gh auth status`. If `gh` has a real user token with `repo` scope, prefer that over the Codespaces token.
- Read the persistent `gho_...` token from `/home/codespace/.config/gh/hosts.yml` and use it for `fetch`/`push` via `git -c credential.helper= -c core.askPass= -c http.https://github.com/.extraheader="AUTHORIZATION: basic ..."` so git stops using the wrong token.
- If push then fails with `non-fast-forward`, fetch `origin`, create a clean `worktree` from `origin/main`, replay only the intended durable commits there, drop accidentally staged files, and push from that clean worktree instead of forcing from the dirty main worktree.
- Never stop at “403” as the final state if a valid `gh` user token is available locally; recover the correct auth path and finish the sync.
